# Extended_Kalman_FIlters

Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

The goal of this project is to build an Extended Kalman Filter using C++ and
use it to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy LIDAR
and RADAR measurements.

The measurements data is provided in the form of a [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

The key metrics are [RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) values for both position and velocity of the tracked
object.
